The following SQL query attempts to use a subquery in the FROM clause that references a column from the outer query. This is not allowed in standard SQL, and may lead to syntax errors or unexpected behavior depending on the specific database system being used:

```sql
SELECT 
    o.order_id, 
    (SELECT SUM(oi.quantity * oi.price) FROM order_items oi WHERE oi.order_id = o.order_id) as total_amount
FROM 
    orders o;
```

This query intends to calculate the total amount for each order. The problem is that `o.order_id` is not available in the subquery's scope in many database systems.
